### Pokemon and scripting. 
There is a lab which has been taught many times in this class which involves bash scripting and pokemon. Specifically, it focuses on how to make bash scripts and ends with using a fancy bash script from the internet that prints out pokemon.

The starter code for this lab can be found [here](https://github.com/ucsd-cse29/lab10-scripting-and-pokemon)
